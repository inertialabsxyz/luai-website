## HERO

**Inertia Labs**  
**Building trust infrastructure for AI agent execution.**

Agents can act. But can you prove what they did?  
We’re building **Luai** — a deterministic execution layer for AI-generated workflows, with policy controls and audit-ready traces.

## PROBLEM

## Agent execution is a black box

Enterprises can deploy agents, but production trust breaks on execution:

- actions are hard to govern in real time
- failures are hard to replay and debug
- audit evidence is incomplete or inconsistent
- high-risk workflows still require manual fallback

If AI can move money, modify systems, or execute operations, execution must be controlled and verifiable.

---

## SOLUTION

## Meet Luai (in development)

Luai is an execution assurance layer for agent actions:

- **Policy-gated execution** before sensitive actions run
- **Deterministic transcripts** for replay and root-cause analysis
- **Reliability controls** for retries, recovery, and safe failure handling
- **Audit-ready evidence** for compliance and internal governance

Built for high-stakes workflows where trust matters more than demo speed.

---

## WHO IT’S FOR

## Built for teams running real agent workflows

- AI Platform teams
- Security / Governance teams
- Finance & Operations leaders
- Compliance and audit stakeholders

Use cases: payment approvals, IT runbooks, reconciliation workflows, and other risk-sensitive automations.

---

## WHY NOW

## Why now

Agent adoption is accelerating, but execution assurance is fragmented across frameworks, logs, and guardrails.  
The next wave of agent products will be won on **control, reliability, and provability** — not orchestration alone.

## DESIGN PARTNER CTA

## Become a design partner

We’re working with a small set of teams building high-stakes agent workflows.

As a design partner, you get:
- early product access
- direct roadmap input
- implementation support
- priority onboarding

**Tell us about your workflow:**  
[Form: name, company, role, workflow, current stack, biggest risk]

## FAQ

## FAQ

**Do I need to change my existing agent framework?**  
No. Luai is being designed to sit between orchestration and action execution.

**Is Luai open source?**  
Core runtime components are planned to be open, with commercial infrastructure for enterprise controls and governance.

**Is this available now?**  
Currently in implementation. Join the design partner list for early access.

**What workflows are best suited first?**  
High-consequence operations: financial actions, system changes, and compliance-sensitive tasks.
